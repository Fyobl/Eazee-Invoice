Application now compiles cleanly with enhanced stability (August 2025).
- COMPREHENSIVE TYPESCRIPT ERROR ELIMINATION: Successfully resolved all remaining TypeScript compilation errors, achieving ZERO TypeScript errors across the entire codebase. Fixed 69+ additional errors including Customer/User type annotations, string/number ID mismatches, form validation schemas, email system type handling, product pricing conversions, and error suppression utilities.
