# GitHub Integration Setup

## Overview
This guide will help you connect your SaaS invoice management application to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## Prerequisites
- A GitHub account
- Git installed on your system (if working locally)
- This Replit project

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner
3. Select "New repository"
4. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `invoicepro-saas` (or your preferred name)
   - **Description**: `A comprehensive SaaS platform for freelancers to manage invoices, quotes, customers, and products with Firebase backend and trial-based access control`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private
   - **Initialize**: Leave unchecked (we'll push existing code)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Initialize Git in Your Replit Project

Open the Replit shell and run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .FreelanceFoundry

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: SaaS invoice management application with Firebase integration"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Environment Variables Setup

Create a `.env.example` file to document required environment variables:

```env
# Firebase Configuration
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id
```

## Step 4: Update .gitignore

Ensure your `.gitignore` file includes:

```gitignore
# Dependencies
node_modules/
package-lock.json

# Environment variables
.env
.env.local
.env.production
.env.development

# Build outputs
dist/
build/

# IDE files
.vscode/
.idea/

# OS files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*

# Runtime data
pids
*.pid
*.seed
*.pid.lock

# Coverage directory used by tools like istanbul
coverage/

# Firebase
.firebase/
firebase-debug.log
```

## Step 5: Create a README.md

A comprehensive README will help others understand and contribute to your project.

## Step 6: Set up GitHub Actions (Optional)

For automated deployment and CI/CD, you can set up GitHub Actions workflows.

## Current Project Structure

Your project includes:
- React frontend with TypeScript
- Firebase Authentication and Firestore
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
- Express.js backend
- GBP currency formatting throughout
- Trial-based subscription model
- PDF generation capabilities

## Next Steps

1. Follow the commands above to push your code to GitHub
2. Set up branch protection rules
3. Configure automated deployments
4. Set up issue templates and contributing guidelines

## Collaboration Features Available

Once on GitHub, you can:
- Track issues and feature requests
- Review code changes through pull requests
- Manage releases and versioning
- Set up automated testing and deployment
- Collaborate with other developers
